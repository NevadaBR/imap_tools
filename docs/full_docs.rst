README.rst is the only documentation.
There is no full API reference docs.

I tried to describe the library API as much as possible in README.rst
If you are using some imap_tools entity, just look at its args at source code by your IDE:
doc strings are present, argument types annotated.

Maybe I will make docs after 1.0.0 release or after donation for it.
